<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>WaveGen is a wave generator Freeframe effect for Windows 2000/XP. If you have any experience with analog synthesizers (or their virtual equivalent), the parameters should be familiar.

<h3>PARAMETERS</h3>

<ol>

<li><b>Car Waveform</b>
</br>Carrier waveform: 0 = Triangle, .125 = Sine, .25 = Ramp Up, .375 = Ramp Down, .5 = Square, .625 = Pulse, .75 = Random, .875 = Random Ramp.

<li><b>Car Frequency</b>
</br>Carrier frequency, on a logarithmic scale: 0 = .001 Hz, .25 = .01 Hz, .5 = .1 Hz, .75 = 1 Hz, 1 = 10 Hz.

<li><b>Car Amplitude</b>
</br>Carrier amplitude, from 0 to 1. At 0, there's no output; at 1, the output fills the entire frame.

<li><b>Car Pulse Width</b>
</br>Carrier pulse width (duty cycle): 0 = all low, .5 = 50%, 1 = all high. Only affects the output when the carrier waveform is "Pulse".

<li><b>Car Phase Shift</b>
</br>Shift the carrier phase by this much per frame. The unit is time, not degrees. Effectively sets the amount of scrolling: 0 = maximum reverse, .5 = no scrolling, 1 = maximum forward.

<li><b>Mod Type</b>
</br>Modulation type: 0 = None, .25 = AM (Amplitude Modulation), .5 = FM (Frequency Modulation), .75 = PM (Pulse Width Modulation). Note that when PM is selected, the carrier's waveform is automatically forced to "Pulse".

<li><b>Mod Waveform</b>
</br>Modulator waveform: 0 = Triangle, .125 = Sine, .25 = Ramp Up, .375 = Ramp Down, .5 = Square, .625 = Pulse, .75 = Random, .875 = Random Ramp.

<li><b>Mod Frequency</b>
</br>Modulator frequency, on a logarithmic scale: 0 = .001 Hz, .25 = .01 Hz, .5 = .1 Hz, .75 = 1 Hz, 1 = 10 Hz.

<li><b>Mod Amplitude</b>
</br>Modulator amplitude, from 0 to 1. At 0, there's no modulation; at 1, the modulation's "swing" is at unity.

<li><b>Mod Pulse Width</b>
</br>Modulator pulse width (duty cycle): 0 = all low, .5 = 50%, 1 = all high. Only affects the output when the modulator waveform is "Pulse".

<li><b>Mod Phase Shift</b>
</br>Shift the modulator phase by this much per frame. The unit is time, not degrees. Effectively sets the amount of scrolling: 0 = maximum reverse, .5 = no scrolling, 1 = maximum forward.

<li><b>Zoom</b>
</br>Magnification in the horizontal axis, on a logarithmic scale: 0 = x0.1, .5 = x1, 1 = x10. Note that in vertical mode, Zoom affects the vertical axis instead.

<li><b>Vertical</b>
</br>If non-zero, draw the output wave vertically instead of horizontally.

<li><b>Fill</b>
</br>If non-zero, fill in the wave instead drawing it as a line.

<li><b>Erase Bkgnd</b>
</br>If non-zero, erase the background to black; otherwise, the frame's previous contents are the background.

<li><b>Line Width</b>
</br>The width of the line, as a scaled percentage of the frame height: 0 = 1 pixel, .5 = 5% of frame height, 1 = 10% of frame height. Only affects the output in line-drawing mode.

<li><b>Show Origin</b>
</br>If non-zero, show the origin vector.

<li><b>Red</b>
</br>Sets the red component of the drawing color.

<li><b>Green</b>
</br>Sets the green component of the drawing color.

<li><b>Blue</b>
</br>Sets the blue component of the drawing color.

<li><b>Invert</b>
</br>If non-zero, invert the filled area, i.e. what was background is now filled and vice versa; only affects the output in fill mode.

</ol>

<h3>NOTES</h3>

<p>Try doing AM or PM with the carrier and modulator phase shifts set to scroll slowly in opposite directions.

<p>Also try setting carrier and modulator frequencies nearly the same for nice interference.

<p>Warning: be careful with zoom < .5, as zooming too far out may overload your CPU!
