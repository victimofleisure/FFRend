<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>FFRend (Freeframe Renderer) is a renderer for Freeframe plugins. It allows you to <a href="help.php?topic=Help/Plugins/Plugin_chains.htm">chain</a> any number of plugins together, <a href="help.php?topic=Help/Parameters/Automating_parameters.htm">automate</a> their parameters using oscillators, and <a href="help.php?topic=Help/Recording/Recording.htm">record</a> the output to an AVI file. The <a href="help.php?topic=Help/Plugins/Input_video.htm">input</a> is a video (AVI/MPG), still image (BMP/JPG/GIF), or source plugin.

<p>Most VJ softwares support Freeframe, and can record their output, so what makes FFRend different? FFRend is optimized for <b>content generation</b>, whereas VJ softwares are typically optimized for live performance. The key difference is that FFRend <a href="help.php?topic=Help/Loose_Ends/Frame-dropping.htm"><b>never drops frames</b></a>, even when your project is too CPU-intensive to be rendered in real time.

<p>It's also possible to perform with FFRend. The user interface is modular, dual-monitor is fully supported, and all parameters and oscillator settings can be controlled via <a href="help.php?topic=Help/MIDI/MIDI_setup.htm">MIDI</a>. Version 2 also supports parallel processing on multi-core CPUs, for greatly improved <a href="help.php?topic=Help/Options/Frame_rate.htm">frame rates</a>.

<p>FFRend supports <b>plugin authoring</b>, which means you can export a FFRend <a href="help.php?topic=Help/Projects/Projects.htm">project</a> as a Freeframe plugin. The exported plugin is called a <a href="help.php?topic=Help/Metaplugins/Metaplugins.htm">metaplugin</a>, because it uses other plugins as components. A metaplugin can be used in any Freeframe-compatible host application, and behaves as if you were running the equivalent project in FFRend.

<p>FFRend is free, open-source software for Windows XP/Vista/Win7. It includes comprehensive help, an installer, and a simple <a href="help.php?topic=Help/Getting_Started/Demo_project.htm">demo project</a>. If you want to render complex effects at high resolution, using chains of automated Freeframe plugins, FFRend is your friend.
