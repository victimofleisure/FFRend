<h3>Bypass and solo</h3>

<p>A plugin can be temporarily <em>bypassed</em>, i.e. disabled so that it has no effect on the output. The bypass state is a toggle: to disable or reenable the selected plugin, use <span class="cmd">Plugin/Bypass</span>, or choose <span class="cmd">Bypass</span> from the plugin context menu.

<p>It's also possible to <span class="cmd">solo</span> a plugin, i.e. bypass all plugins except the selected plugin. This can be useful for isolating problems. Solo is also a toggle: to enter solo mode, use <span class="cmd">Plugin/Solo</span>, or choose <span class="cmd">Solo</span> from the plugin context menu. Choose solo a second time to exit solo mode; this restores the bypass settings that were in effect when solo mode was entered.

<p>Note that Bypass works in solo mode; this allows you to solo a plugin, and then add the other plugins back into the chain one at a time, by un-bypassing them.

<p>Also note that in version 2, bypass/solo doesn't change the routing, therefore it's possible to get unexpected results.
