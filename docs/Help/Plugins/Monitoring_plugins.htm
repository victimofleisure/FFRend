<h3>Monitoring plugins</h3>

<p>The Monitor control bar normally displays the output of the entire <a href="../Plugins/Plugin_chains.htm">plugin chain</a> (i.e. the same image as the output window), but it can be configured to display the output of a specific plugin instead. This feature lets you examine any intermediate stage in your plugin chain, in a nondestructive way, without affecting FFRend's output. It's mostly useful for debugging, but it can also be used for previewing.

<p>Before you try to monitor anything, make sure the Monitor bar is visible. To show or hide the Monitor bar, use <span class="cmd">View/Monitor</span> or <span class="key">Shift+N</span>. To monitor a plugin, select it, and then use <span class="cmd">Plugin/Monitor</span> or <span class="key">F8</span>. A monitor icon is displayed in the plugin's tab, to remind you that the monitor source was changed. To return to monitoring FFRend's output, choose <span class="cmd">Plugin/Monitor</span> again. You can also control the monitor source via the Plugin or Patch Bay context menus, or the Monitor bar's context menu.
