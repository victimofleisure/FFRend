<h3>Reordering plugins</h3>

<p>Unless you create an explicit <a href="../Plugins/Patch_Bay.htm">routing</a>, the order in which plugins appear in the <a href="../Plugins/Plugin_chains.htm">plugin chain</a> determines the order in which they process video. The plugins can be reordered at any time, without disrupting their states, via drag and drop. To move a plugin, left-click on its tab, and while holding down the left mouse button, drag the cursor horizontally. The cursor changes, to indicate that you're in drag mode. To drop the plugin, position the cursor over the desired tab and release the left mouse button. The plugin is moved to the new location, and the output is affected immediately.
