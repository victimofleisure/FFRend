<h3>Plugin slots</h3>

<p>A <em>slot</em> is a container into which a Freeframe plugin can be <a href="../Plugins/Loading_plugins.htm">loaded</a>. Plugin slots are represented by tabs along the top of FFRend's main window. To insert a slot, use <span class="cmd">Edit/Insert</span>, or the <span class="key">Ins key</span>. To delete a slot, use <span class="cmd">Edit/Delete</span>, or the <span class="key">Del</span> key. Plugins can also be inserted and deleted using the plugin context menu, which is displayed when you right-click on a tab.

<p>Only one plugin slot can be viewed at a time. This slot is referred to as the <em>selected plugin</em>. To select a slot, left-click on its tab.

<p>A plugin slot can be cut or copied to the clipboard, and then pasted to a different <a href="../Projects/Projects.htm">project</a>, or elsewhere within the same project, using the standard Edit commands, or the plugin context menu.
