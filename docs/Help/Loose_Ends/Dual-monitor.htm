<h3>Dual-monitor</h3>

<p>FFRend supports a dual-monitor setup, in which its main window and output are displayed on two different monitors. In the usual case, the main window is on the primary monitor (the built-in display on laptops), and the output is on the secondary monitor, but the reverse also works.

<p>To make FFRend use a secondary monitor, you must first extend your Windows desktop onto the secondary monitor. This is typically done using Control Panel/Display/Settings, or in some cases via software that came with your graphics card. Once you've extended the desktop, you can drag FFRend's output window onto the secondary monitor. Now when you enable <a href="../Loose_Ends/Full_screen.htm">full screen</a> mode, the output window fills the secondary monitor.
