<h3>Column resizing</h3>

<p>The parameter view and some of the control bar views have resizable columns. The columns are resized via the column header, just as in a standard list control. To resize a column, move the cursor to the column header and position it over the divider to the right of the column you want to resize. The cursor changes to a vertical bar with two arrows. Press and hold down the left mouse button, and drag the divider horizontally until the column has the desired width.

<p>It's possible to hide a column by reducing its width to zero. A column hidden in this manner can be restored as follows: move the cursor to the column header and position it slightly to the right of the divider where the hidden column used to be. The cursor changes to a double vertical bar with two arrows. Press and hold down the left mouse button, and drag the cursor to the right to restore the hidden column.

<p>To reset a column to its default width, double-click the divider to the right of the column. To reset all columns to their default widths, first ensure the view has input focus, e.g. by left-clicking anywhere within its column header, and then while holding down the <span class="key">Ctrl</span> key, press the <span class="key">+</span> key on the numeric keypad. If you're using a laptop, it may not have a dedicated numeric keypad, in which case you may need to also hold down a function key that enables numeric keypad mode.
