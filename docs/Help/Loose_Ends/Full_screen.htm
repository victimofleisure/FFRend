<h3>Full screen</h3>

<p>FFRend's output can be displayed full-screen, so that the output window fills the entire display, and all other windows are hidden. The other main advantage of full-screen is that it uses DirectDraw Exclusive to eliminate <a href="../Loose_Ends/Tearing.htm">tearing</a>.

<p>To enable or disable full-screen mode, use <span class="cmd">Window/Full Screen</span> or <span class="key">Ctrl+F11</span>.
