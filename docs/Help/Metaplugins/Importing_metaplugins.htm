<h3>Importing metaplugins</h3>

<p>It's possible to import a <a href="../Metaplugins/Metaplugins.htm">metaplugin</a> back into FFRend as a <a href="../Projects/Projects.htm">project</a>. This allows you to edit and <a href="../Metaplugins/Exporting_metaplugins.htm">re-export</a> a metaplugin, even if you don't have the project file from which it was originally created. To import a metaplugin, use <span class="cmd">File/Metaplugin/Import</span>. Select a filename, and press OK.

<p>Note that if you only want to know which plugins a metaplugin uses, it's not necessary to import the metaplugin; it's easier to use the <a href="../Projects/File_Browser.htm">file browser</a>. Find the metaplugin in the file browser's Plugins pane, right-click the metaplugin's name, and select Properties. The properties dialog lists the component plugins, and tells you whether they're linked or embedded.
