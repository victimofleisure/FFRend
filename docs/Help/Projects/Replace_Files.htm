<h3>Replace Files</h3>

<p>If "Open Dialog" is selected in the <a href="../Projects/Missing_Files.htm">Missing Files</a> dialog, the Replace Files dialog is displayed. It lists the name and current status of each missing plugin, and gives you the following options:

<dl>

<dt>Browse
<dd>Allows broken links to be repaired individually. This is useful if a plugin has been renamed rather than moved. To repair a link, select it in the list (left-click its name), and press Browse. A file dialog is displayed. Locate the plugin, select it, and press Open. The link's status is updated from "Missing" to "Replaced".

<dt>Search Folder
<dd>Allows you to search for missing plugins in a specific folder. The search is recursive, i.e. subfolders of the specified folder are also searched. Use this option when you know where the missing plugins are, even approximately. When you press the button, a folder dialog is displayed; select a folder, and press "OK" to begin searching. As links are repaired, their status changes from "Missing" to "Replaced". The search can be repeated in different folders, until all the missing plugins have been found.

<dt>Search All
<dd>Searches for missing plugins in ALL folders of ALL hard disks. This can take a long time, so you should only do this if you have no idea where the missing plugins are.

<dt>OK
<dd>Ends the dialog and opens the project. Plugins that are still missing are removed from the project; see the warning below.

<dt>Cancel
<dd>Ends the dialog and cancels opening the project.

</dl>

<p>Warning: If plugins are still missing when you press "OK", they are removed from the project. If you save the project in this situation, the missing plugins are <em>permanently deleted</em> from the project. To avoid doing this accidentally, save the project under a new name (using <span class="cmd">File/Save As</span>) before proceeding.
