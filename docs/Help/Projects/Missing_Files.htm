<h3>Missing Files</h3>

<p>A <a href="../Projects/Projects.htm">project</a> contains <em>links</em> to plugins. If a project's plugins are moved or renamed, broken links can occur. Broken links must be repaired before the project can be opened. If you try to open a project with broken links, FFRend displays the Missing Files dialog, which gives you the following options:

<dl>

<dt>Search & Proceed
<dd>Searches ALL folders of ALL hard disks for the missing plugins. This could take a long time, so only use this option when you have no idea where the missing plugins are. If you know where they are, even approximately, it's much faster to use the "Open Dialog" option instead. When the search is complete, the project is opened. Plugins that aren't found are removed from the project; see the warning below.

<dt>Proceed
<dd>Opens the project immediately, regardless of broken links. The missing plugins are removed from the project; see the warning below.

<dt>Open Dialog
<dd>Displays the <a href="../Projects/Replace_Files.htm">Replace Files</a> dialog, which lists the names of the missing plugins, and allows you to browse for them individually, or search for them in specific folders. If you want more control over the repair process, or if you know where the missing plugins are, even approximately, use this option instead of "Search & Proceed".

<dt>Cancel
<dd>Cancels opening the project.

</dl>

<p>Warning: In all of the above cases except "Cancel", it's possible to open the project with plugins still missing. If you save the project in this situation, the missing plugins are <em>permanently deleted</em> from the project. To avoid doing this accidentally, save the project under a new name (using <span class="cmd">File/Save As</span>) before proceeding.
