<h3>Projects</h3>

<p>The entire <a href="../Plugins/Plugin_chains.htm">plugin chain</a>, including all plugin <a href="../Parameters/Parameters.htm">parameters</a> and their <a href="../Parameters/Automating_parameters.htm">automations</a>, can be saved in a single document, called a <em>project</em>. To save your work as a project, use <span class="cmd">File/Save</span> or <span class="cmd">File/Save As</span>. To open an existing project, use <span class="cmd">File/Open</span>. To start a new project, use <span class="cmd">File/New</span>.

<p>A project doesn't actually contain plugins; instead it contains <em>links</em> to plugins. Consequently, if plugins are moved or renamed, broken links can occur; see <a href="../Projects/Missing_Files.htm">missing files</a>. The project also includes a link to the <a href="../Plugins/Input_video.htm">input video</a> if applicable. In general all settings are stored in the project, except for those found in the options dialog, which are stored in the registry.
