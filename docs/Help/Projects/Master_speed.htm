<h3>Master speed</h3>

<p>The Master toolbar allows you to affect the speed of all your <a href="../Parameters/Automating_parameters.htm">automations</a> at once. The toolbar contains a scaling percentage that's applied to your oscillator frequencies. If the scaling percentage is 100 (the default), the automations are unaffected; at 200 they're double speed, and at 50 they're half speed. To display or hide the toolbar, use <span class="cmd">View/Master</span> or <span class="key">Shift+M</span>. To change the master speed, set the desired percentage, via either the slider or the edit box.

<p>If the CPU is <a href="../Loose_Ends/Performance.htm">overloaded</a> while you're developing a <a href="../Projects/Projects.htm">project</a>, the actual <a href="../Options/Frame_rate.htm">frame rate</a> may be less than the ideal, which means your automations may seem slower than they actually are. You might not discover this problem until you <a href="../Recording/Recording.htm">record</a> the project and watch the output video. If this situation occurs, you can use master speed to slow down your automations proportionally, instead of editing them one by one.
