<h3>Installing</h3>

<p><b>Installing for the first time:</b>

<p>FFRend is distributed as a .zip file. Unzip the distribution file, using WinZip or an equivalent program, and then double-click on FFRend.msi to launch the installer. The installer is about as simple as an installer can be: just keep hitting "Next." Note that on the "Select Installation Folder" page, you have the option to install for all users, or only for the current user.

<p><b>Upgrading a previous installation:</b>

<ol>
<li>Unzip the distribution file to a folder, if you haven't already.
<li>In that folder, double-click Upgrade.bat to launch the installer.
<li>In the installer, select the "Repair" option.
</ol>

<p>Note that double-clicking FFRend.msi won't work: you will get the message "Another version of this product is already installed".

<p>It is possible to have both versions 1 and 2 installed on the same machine. However, uninstalling either version may cause the other to fail during <a href="../Recording/Recording.htm">recording</a>, with the message "Can't create BmpToAvi filter. Class not registered". To fix this, rerun the installer for the remaining version, and select "Repair".
