<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>FFRend (Freeframe Renderer) is a renderer for Freeframe plugins. It allows you to <a href="../Plugins/Plugin_chains.htm">chain</a> any number of plugins together, <a href="../Parameters/Automating_parameters.htm">automate</a> their parameters using oscillators, and <a href="../Recording/Recording.htm">record</a> the output to an AVI file. The <a href="../Plugins/Input_video.htm">input</a> is a video (AVI/MPG), still image (BMP/JPG/GIF), or source plugin.

<p>Most VJ softwares support Freeframe, and can record their output, so what makes FFRend different? FFRend is optimized for content generation, whereas VJ softwares are typically optimized for live performance. The key difference is that FFRend <a href="../Loose_Ends/Frame-dropping.htm">never drops frames</a>, even when your project is too CPU-intensive to be rendered in real time.

<p>It's also possible to perform with FFRend. The user interface is modular, dual-monitor is fully supported, and all parameters and oscillator settings can be controlled via <a href="../MIDI/MIDI_setup.htm">MIDI</a>. Version 2 also supports parallel processing on multi-core CPUs, for greatly improved throughput.

<p>FFRend supports plugin authoring, which means you can export a FFRend <a href="../Projects/Projects.htm">project</a> as a Freeframe plugin. The exported plugin is called a <a href="../Metaplugins/Metaplugins.htm">metaplugin</a>, because it uses other plugins as components. A metaplugin can be used in any Freeframe-compatible host application, and behaves as if you were running the equivalent project in FFRend.

<p>FFRend is free, open-source software for Windows 2000/XP/Vista/Win7. It includes comprehensive help, an installer, and a simple <a href="../Getting_Started/Demo_project.htm">demo project</a>. If you want to render complex effects at high resolution, using chains of automated Freeframe plugins, FFRend is for you.
