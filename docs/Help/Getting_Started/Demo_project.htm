<h3>Demo project</h3>

<p>FFRend's binary distribution includes a simple demonstration <a href="../Projects/Projects.htm">project</a>, called DemoBall.ffp. You'll find it in the same folder as the application (typically C:\Program Files\FFRend). DemoBall <a href="../Plugins/Loading_plugins.htm">loads</a> a Freeframe plugin (FFSrcPlug.dll, also included) which displays a bouncing ball. The plugin has a single <a href="../Parameters/Parameters.htm">parameter</a>, the ball speed. This parameter is <a href="../Parameters/Automating_parameters.htm">automated</a>, using a ramp down <a href="../Parameters/Oscillator_waveforms.htm">waveform</a>, so that the ball gradually slows down and then suddenly speeds up again.
