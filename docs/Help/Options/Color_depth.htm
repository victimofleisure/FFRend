<h3>Color depth</h3>

<p>This is the color depth of FFRend's rendering engine, in bits per pixel. Only plugins that support the selected color depth can be loaded. For optimal results, the selected color depth should match the color depth of the display device. If it doesn't, FFRend warns you and gives you an opportunity to fix it. Ignoring this warning may cause the output window to show garbled data.
