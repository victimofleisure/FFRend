<h3>View frequency</h3>

<p>This option specifies the rate at which the user interface is updated, in Hertz. This rate is completely independent of the engine's <a href="../Options/Frame_rate.htm">frame rate</a>. It controls the smoothness of slider motion for <a href="../Parameters/Automating_parameters.htm">automations</a>, the refresh rate of the Monitor bar, and the speed of the History and Queues views.
