<h3>History size</h3>

<p>This option determines the size of each plugin's event buffer in the History view. To capture a longer history, increase this size. The size is in measured in events. Since there are two events per frame, a size of 256 is enough for 128 frames. Memory usage is 8 bytes per event, times the number of plugins.
